                Gengar is a shadow-like, round-bodied Pokémon with two large, pointed ears and short spikes lining its back. Gengar has two red eyes and a toothy, sinister smile. It has claws on its hands. Gengar stands on its two short legs, but it can Levitate as well.

                In Mega Gengar, it has a hot pink smoke around it, a third yellow eye, and its hands are buried in the ground. It also has more spikes on its back and tail.

                In Gigantamax Gengar, it has grown much larger. Its red eyes have turned yellow with soulless white pupils and the body has remained mostly the same aside from the absence of visible physical feet and detached hands that are in the ground. It has a massive mouth that resembles some sort of room with a long tongue inside.

                Charizard is a large, dragon-like Pokémon that differs greatly from its pre-evolved form. The red skin coloration of Charmeleon is no longer apparent, as Charizard appears to have reverted to the orange/yellow coloration of Charmander. Two large fangs can be seen when its mouth is closed. When its mouth is open, its lower fangs and a slender but long tongue can be seen. The single horn that was on the back of its head is now two, one on either side. The most notable difference between Charizard and its pre-evolved forms are the large wings that have developed on its back, which gives Charizard the capability of flying.

                In Generation II, Shiny Charizard was purple with the inside of its wings being green. In Generation III onwards, Shiny Charizard's orange skin is black while the blue of its wings is maroon.

                Rhyhorn is a gray rhinoceros-like Pokémon that has rock hard skin and armor covering its body. It has spikes on top of it to protect itself from its foes. It walks on four legs and has a horn that can be used as a drill. And it has two toes on each foot and two sharp teeth sticking out of its mouth.

                While powerful, Rhyhorn are not the smartest Pokémon in the world. They are said to only be able to remember one thing at a time. While that is not true, they are still rather dense Pokémon. They will often charge at something but forget why they began charging in the first place mid-run; they will not stop running until they tire out and collapse from exhaustion, however. Sometimes, destroying things help Rhyhorn remember why they began running.

                Blastoise are large, tortoise-like Pokémon with some features similar to those of its pre-evolved forms. Blastoise has a large blue body, cream-colored stomach, small fat arms and legs, and a large brown shell rimmed with white, featuring its water cannons. It is now noticeably bulkier than its previous evolutions. Like its pre-evolved forms, Blastoise has a shell which covers its entire body, which it can also be withdrawn into. Contrary to Squirtle and Wartortle, Blastoise has large, water cannons that are located on the top left and right sides. The water that comes out of the cannons is capable of punching holes through thick steel.
